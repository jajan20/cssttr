## CSS to the Rescue
Link to webpage: https://jajan20.github.io/cssttr/index.html

#### Progress
##### Week 1

- sketched different layouts for a design.
- Used CSS Secrets to add different styles
	- Fancy ampersands (page 462)
	- De-emphasize by dimming (page 546)
	- De-emphasize by blurring (page 555)
	- Intrinsic sizing (page 602)
	- Styling by sibling count (page 616)
	- Vertical Centering (page 641)

While writing this I haven't used every style element mentioned above. Since I'm still changing my layout of the site. When I'll dive into styling my components I'm sure I can use the rest of the styling elements.

#### Review
I started of great, It's been a while since I worked with css. But as the code progressed I realised that writing css without the use of classes is quite the challenge. This resulted in a bit of spaghetti CSS, combining pseudo-classes to refer to the right element, using extra tags to fit my needs.

#### Next Week
###### To do
- optimize the code
- adding styling to the components
- adding the "pleasureable"
- Finish the assignment
